Apache Solr Search Block

Description:
This module provides a search field block for Apache Solr search pages. If the block is visible on a search page, it performs a hook_apachesolr_search_page_alter() to hide the default search field in the content area, and implements a search field in the included block.  SInce the search field generated is identical to the original search field, all search functionality remains the same.
