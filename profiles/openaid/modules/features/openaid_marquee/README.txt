Description:
The OpenAid Marquee feature provides a Marquee Content node type where users can upload an image, set a title, text and read more link url. The Marquee Content is then displayed in a rotating marquee block created by Views (rotating_marquee) using the Views Slideshow display. Marquee Content is ordered by post date, so content can easily be positioned by adjusting the date. A Context (marquee_front) is included to insert the marquee block into the home page.
