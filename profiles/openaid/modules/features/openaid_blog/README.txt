Description:
The OpenAid Blog feature provides functionality to include a blog on your site. To do this it creates two content types: Blog and Author Profile. Author Profiles allow you to capture blog author information and they also separate the blog authors from site users so that blog posts may be attributed to authors who do not have user accounts on the site. The Feature also creates a Profile Thumbnail image style so that Author Profile photos can be uniformly sized. The main blog listing, archives and RSS feeds are provided by Views with a number of Contexts to attach various Views blocks for navigation. The main blog page is automatically added to the Main menu.
