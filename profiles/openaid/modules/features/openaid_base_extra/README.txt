OpenAid Base Extra

Description:
The Extra modules perform tasks that are not safe to include directly in Features code due to the possibility of overwrites.
The OpenAid Base Extra module contains code to set the site front page and 404 page to the content created by the OpenAid Base Feature. It also contains code to create the Language taxonomy (with English and French as terms) and creates default settings for the Apache Solr search functionality.
As a more traditional module, the OpenAid Base Extra creates a footer block with settings for copyright, logo and logo URL (which you can use to link the logo to a specific site or page). This block is automatically added to the footer via a Context in the OpenAid Base Feature.
