Description:
The OpenAid Contact Feature creates a webform based contact form. To do this, it first creates a Webform content type, then it creates a Contact node with email and message fields. Once enabled, the Admin Content area will display a Webforms tab (admin/content/webform) where administrative links for all webforms on the site can be accessed and information about submissions can be viewed. To complete setup of the Contact page, navigate to the previously mentioned Webforms tab, find the Contact form and click the corresponding Edit link. Enter a message to appear on your contact form and save the page. Next, click the Contact page's Weform tab, then the E-mails subtab. Set the Address field to the email address where you wish to deliver the contact form submissions, then click the Add button. FInally click the Form settings subtab and enter a confirmation message to be displayed after a user successfully submits the contact form.
